The "open," "close," "high," "low," and "adjusted close" are common terms used to describe the prices of a stock on a given trading day. Here's what each of these terms means:

Open Price: The open price is the price at which a stock starts trading at the beginning of a trading session. It is the first price at which the stock is traded on that particular day.

Close Price: The close price is the final price at which a stock trades at the end of a trading session. It is the last price recorded for the stock on that day.

High Price: The high price represents the highest price at which a stock was traded during the trading session. It indicates the peak value the stock reached during that day.

Low Price: The low price is the lowest price at which a stock was traded during the trading session. It represents the lowest value the stock reached during that day.

Adjusted Close Price: The adjusted close price is the closing price of a stock, adjusted for factors such as dividends, stock splits, or other corporate actions. It provides a more accurate representation of the stock's value over time, accounting for these additional factors.

These prices, when analyzed together, can provide insights into a stock's trading activity and price movements throughout a specific trading day.

**Moving average(MA)** is a commonly used statistical indicator to analyze data trends over a specific period of time. It helps to smooth out fluctuations or noise in the data and provides a clearer picture of the underlying trend. It is calculated by taking the average of a specified number of data points within a sliding window that moves through the dataset. As new data points become available, the window shifts, and the average is recalculated.

Strategy of Technical analyst to analyze stock If the 100-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA, it suggests that the shorter-term average is rising faster than the longer-term average, indicating **uptrend** and vice-versa
